;;; You can run an emacs deamon by executing
;;; emacs --deamon
;;; This will call server-start, will return control to the terminal and wait for client requests

;;; Once done the above, you can run the emacsclient binary by using emacsclient -t /path/to/file and this
;;; will open emacs in your terminal :)
